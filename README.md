# float(0.1) + float(0.2) == float(0.3) is true 

Isn't this the solution to many of the problems of binary floating point arithmetic?
After all, this is a strict value of zero. This is a bitwise comparison of binary numbers. This is the absence of the need for an infinite increase in the dimension of the operational registers to achieve closeness to the decimal result. This is the natural portability of software. This is a simple solution to boundary value problems in the transition to numbers bordering on overflow and underflow. As well as problem with subnormal numbers.
Doesn't this deserve your attention?
Prove me mathematically if I'm wrong.
